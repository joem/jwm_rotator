History
-------
When I originally started this, I knew of nothing quite like it so it was written from scratch. But over time it became heavily based on https://github.com/rubymaniac/rotator, which, if I had known about from the beginning, I probably could have forked. I don't need the S3 uploading that rubymaniac/rotator seems to be centered around so it does not appear in my version (nor does the whole 'uploader' concept), but it should be possible to add something like that as one of the rotators.
